# Understanding synergistic effect of asymmetry between movie actors

## Abstract
Movie actors have synergistic effects with other actors who appear together.
We focused on the asymmetric interaction of synergy given and received by each, depending on the actor's competence.
This study concentrates on understanding the asymmetric synergy between actors.
We propose an asymmetric synergy measurement method for actor’s star-power-based costarring movies to understand the synergistic effect.
When measuring the synergy, we designed it so that it would be possible to measure the synergy that varies with the time of the costarring movie’s release and the synergy of new actors.
